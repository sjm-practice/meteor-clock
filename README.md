# Meteor Clock (SVG)

This is a simple application created for practice writing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. The base application was generated using 'meteor create --example clock'

The testing framework used is chimp with mocha (so far).

Changes made to application

* added bootstrap
* moved style properties to a css file
* TODO - add some server side testable code.
